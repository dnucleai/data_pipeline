# Parsing Engine

Stage 1 of the NUCLE.AI data pipeline.
A block of client data is parsed through the engine and translated into a JSON encoded data Document for storage in ElasticSearch-enabled database. Appropriate metatags are applied to each Document.

## Getting Started

Follow external readme for cloning this repository. Keep all parsing related operations within this directory and add relevant data to test into the /test_data repository.

Use the following command to add data to the /test_data:

Be sure to use a test branch for prototype development:

Push and pull using the following commands:

Run tests using:
